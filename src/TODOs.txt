Still misses (proper) testcases:

- HaplotypeSampler: update_unique_kmers 
- Variant: separate_variants with SampledPanel (DONE)
- SampledPath: get_specific_alleles
- Graph: write_sampled_panel


Implementation:

- Enable output of the sampled panel in VCF format (standalone command) and genotyping command (make optional)
	* overload separate_variants function to work with SampledPanel objects (DONE)
	* overload write function for writing phased panel VCF with resulting Variants/SampledPanel objects
	* In command PanGenie-sample: output final sampled panel VCF in the end
	* In command PanGenie-genotype: make it optional to output the phased panel in the end: do this as last step after genotyping is done by:
		(1) create list of SampledPanel objects from UniqueKmers objects right before they go out of stepwiseuniquekmercomputer
		(2) use SampledPanel objects together with Graph objects to output the panel VCF (using the above functions)

- increase variable sizes for alleles: now unsigned char --> convert to unsigned short to allow for more alleles/paths
- experiment with alternative ways of implementing KmerPath objects (allele to kmer mapping)
- experiment with smaller hash sizes for jellyfish (does this decrease memory with still exceptable speed?)
